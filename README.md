# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is a simple library for integrating with WrenSys Api

### Setup ###

This library requires two other libraries for properly working:
* AFNetworking
* iAppInfos

I recommend using the CocoaPod spec:
pod "AFNetworking", "~> 2.0"
pod "iAppInfos"
